# FPGA - Raspberry Pi Communication Demo
Sample code for communicating between a raspberry pi and de0 nano at high speed over the GPIO pins by sending the accelerometer data.

## Serial Example

Plug GPIO03 on the de0-nano into pin 10 on the Raspberry Pi.
Plug GPIO05 on the de0-nano into pin 8 on the Raspberry Pi.

To load the de0nano, can either import the verilog and tcl files into your own
quartus project, or use my [pyquartus tool](https://github
.com/CatherineH/python-quartus). To compile and upload using pyquartus, plug
 your de0-nano into your computer, and run:

```
cd de0-nano-raspi-serial-demo
pyquartus -c -u -p de0nano/serial
```

On the raspberry pi side, install the requirements and run the program:

```
cd de0-nano-raspi-serial-demo/raspi
pip install -r requirements.txt
python serial/main.py
```

The serial verilog code was adapted from [Jean P Nicolle at fpga4fun]
(http://fpga4fun.com/).

## Parallel Example

Plug GPIO 10 on the de0-nano into pin 3 on the Raspberry Pi
Plug GPIO 11 on the de0-nano into pin 5 on the Raspberry Pi
Plug GPIO 13 on the de0-nano into pin 7 on the Raspberry Pi
Plug GPIO 15 on the de0-nano into pin 29 on the Raspberry Pi
Plug GPIO 17 on the de0-nano into pin 31 on the Raspberry Pi

To load the de0nano, can either import the verilog and tcl files into your own
quartus project, or use my [pyquartus tool](https://github
.com/CatherineH/python-quartus). To compile and upload using pyquartus, plug
 your de0-nano into your computer, and run:

```
cd de0-nano-raspi-serial-demo
pyquartus -c -u -p de0nano/parallel
```

On the raspberry pi side, install the requirements and run the program:

```
cd de0-nano-raspi-serial-demo/raspi
pip install -r requirements.txt
python parallel/main.py
```
